The lines adjacent to the universal polygon are attributed with a '0' for the 'Hu_level' field. These cannot be attributed until the adjacent states complete their linework, at which point the highest level of the hydrologic unit can be determined. The WBD was produced using digital raster graphic (DRG) images as a source map. Data completeness for DRG files reflect content of the source graphic and may therefore be reflected in the completeness and accuracy of the WBD.</measDesc></report><report type="DQQuanAttAcc" dimension="" xmlns=""><measDesc>The accuracy of this data is dependent on both the level of detail of the source material and the interpretation procedures for capturing that source. The primary limiting factor for the level of detail of the source material is the scale (1:24,000) of the digital raster graphic (DRG). The map scale determines the level of content that may be extracted from the given source during digitization. 1) 100% of the boundary locations were visually verified using the draft 1:250,000-scale boundaries and the DRGs as a reference. Additionally, 10% of the boundary locations were reviewed by the Interagency Hydrologic Unit Group (IHUG). Local knowledge was incorporated into the draft delineations and used to verify boundary locations or digital orthophoto quads (DOQ) of the area were reviewed. 2) 100% of the 'Huc_12', 'Huc_10' and 'Huc_8' values were verified, visually, for accuracy upon attribute transfer from the 1:250,000-scale draft data, or when generated with watershed boundary dataset tools, and then again once the entire dataset was complete. The 'Huc_12' values were also checked to ensure no duplicate numbers were found. 3) 100% of the 'States' attributes were visually checked. 4) 100% of the 'Acres' values were calculated ('Shape_Area' * 0.0002471). 5) The 'Ncontrb_a' (non-contributing area) attributes were first identified during the creation of the 1:250,000-scale data. Non-contributing areas larger than 3,000 acres were attributed as 'closed' (closed basins). 100% of the non-contributing areas were verified using the DRGs during the attribution process. 6) The 'Hu_10_ds' and 'Hu_12_ds' attributes (indicating the Huc_10s and Huc_12s downstream of a hydrologic unit) were visually verified using the National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD) and, where necessary, the DRG. 7) The 'Huc_10_name' and 'Hu_12_name' attributes were checked for duplicates and to ensure that the names comply with the Federal Standards for the Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries (see http://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NCGC/products/watershed/hu-standards.pdf). Hydrologic units are usually named after the most prominent or significant hydrographic feature found within the unit. 8) The 'Hu_10_mod' and 'Hu_12_mod' attributes (indicating modifications to any hydrologic unit's natural boundary location) were identified with the use of NHD, DRG, and, in some cases, DOQ or NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) imagery, and manually noted during the digitizing process for each hydrologic unit. They were then transferred to the WBD and verified during the attribution process. In instances where a mod of 'OT' was used for a hydrologic unit, this was usually to indicate where local-level input was implemented in the delineation process - most notably in some US Forest Service areas, and in and around the San Francisco Bay area. For detailed descriptions of all modification types, see ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NCGC/products/watershed/hu-standards.pdf. 9) 100% of the 'Hu_10_type' and 'Hu_12_type' attributes (indicationg a closed basin, standard watershed, frontal, etc.) were visually verified. For detailed descriptions of all hydrologic unit types, see ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NCGC/products/watershed/hu-standards.pdf.</measDesc></report><report type="DQAbsExtPosAcc" dimension="horizontal" xmlns=""><measDesc>The map was digitized from USGS 1:24,000-scale DRG base maps, with an inherited error of +/- 43 feet according to USGS National Map Accuracy Standards. Digitized line locations were held to the +/- 43-foot accuracy standards by ensuring that all lines were within a 13-meter buffer of where visual interpretation placed the actual boundary. Any lines outside the buffer were corrected. It is estimated that the errors detected were less than 10%. It should be noted that while general rules of hydrology were used (i.e. water flows downhill as opposed to uphill), the location of boundaries is still somewhat subjective as the 1:24,000-scale DRGs do not always provide enough information for identifying the location of the boundaries. In these instances, an additional NED-derived hillshade layer was used and/or group consensus was utilized. Please refer to the 'process description' section for more details on watershed delineation rules. It should be noted that the data was digitzed using NAD27 horizontal datum. The data was then projected to NAD83 horizontal datum as requested by the NRCS. Unquantifiable errors may be associated with coordinate shift.</measDesc></report><report type="DQAbsExtPosAcc" dimension="vertical" xmlns=""><measDesc>N/A</measDesc></report><dataLineage><prcStep xmlns=""><stepDesc>Developing the draft catchment boundaries with Watershed Boundary Dataset Tools, Version 1.0: a) Using the 30-meter National Elevation Dataset (NED) as the elevation source layer - clipped to the extent of the particular sub-basin (buffered by 5,000 meters) - and a National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) as the source layer to determine stream flow direction (clipped to the extent of the non-buffered sub-basin), 'batch terrain preprocessing' was performed, utilizing the 'agree + fill' processing method to create the draft catchments. A stream threshold, which determines the size and quantity of the catchments, was set anywhere from 30,000 and 50,000 cells. b) Post-processing of the draft catchments was performed, eliminating any catchments outside of the NHD and the non-buffered sub-basin. c) The draft catchments were then aggregated into watersheds (10 digit HUCs); using the 'draft lines definition' tools, the catchment directly above a main stream outlet or confluence was selected, thereby selecting all upstream catchments together. The selected catchments were then aggregated to create preliminary watersheds, beginning at the uppermost main stream outlet of the sub-basin, on down. The preliminary watersheds were sized appropriately, in compliance with the guidelines outlined in the Federal Standards (watersheds = 40,000 - 250,000 acres). d) Using the 'generate partial draft lines' function from the 'draft lines definition' toolbar, a draft polygon feature class (at the HUC_10 level) was then generated from the aggregated catchments/watersheds, creating a new watershed layer. (HUC_10 coding/numbering was automated for each polygon in the order of catchment aggregation). e) Using the NHD as a reference to identify major streams/water systems and their confluences, the catchments were then aggregated again into sub watersheds (12 digit HUCs) using the same method as above, to the appropriate size standards (sub watersheds = 10,000 - 40,000 acres). f) A draft polygon feature class (at the HUC_12 level) was generated from the aggregated catchments/sub watersheds, creating a new sub watershed layer (HUC_12 coding/numbering was automated). The draft sub watershed (12-digit) feature class generated above was the dataset used in the editing/digitizing process. Note: although the option to generate a line feature class from the draft polygons exists, we chose to create a line feature (with ArcToolbox) after the draft polygons were completely edited. This is due to the fact that the tools, did not always draft produce the best catchment boundaries; for instance, the tools are dependent on the NHD layer for determining stream flow, and in the case of canals/man-made water systems, the water flow is deemed 'indeterminate' by the NHD, resulting in a poorly-placed pour point to the catchment(s). This way, if draft lines needed significant alteration (i.e. polygons being cut), it need only be performed on the polygon feature class, simplifying the edit process. The process to generate draft boundaries derived from NED was only utilized in certain areas across the state.</stepDesc></prcStep><prcStep xmlns=""><stepDesc>Dataset moved.</stepDesc><stepSrc type="used"><srcCitatn><resAltTitle>D:\Cal-WBD\Work_docs\Metadata\Metadata__8_22_08\Metadata__9_23_08</resAltTitle></srcCitatn></stepSrc></prcStep><prcStep xmlns=""><stepDesc>1:24,000-scale delineation process: a) Using the 250k draft boundaries as reference, and the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and digital raster graphics (DRG) as a background, the 1:24,000-scale boundaries were digitized in ArcMap. Digitizing generally occurred while being zoomed in at anywhere from 1:5,000 - 1:12,000-scale; pour points were digitized at a zoom scale of approximately 1:1,000. Existing line work (i.e. USFS) was inspected for accuracy and used where plausible. As a guide for digitizing the watershed/sub watershed boundaries, the following general watershed boundary delineation rules were applied: 1) drawing boundaries perpendicular to contours wherever possible. 2) never crossing a water feature, drainages, or anywhere contours indicate the location of overland flow would go (except as a pour point/outlet). 3) when delineating along a ridge top, the boundary would be located closer to the side of the ridge with the steepest gradient. 4) pure or 'classic' (sub) watersheds were given high priority and cut out wherever possible, as long as they remained within size requirements (It should be noted that while general rules of hydrology were used, the location of boundaries is still somewhat subjective as the 1:24,000-scale DRG does not always provide enough information for identifying the location of the boundaries; in such instances, additional data including 2005 NAIP color imagery and/or group consensus was used). b) After editing for the polygon feature was complete, a line feature was generated from the finished polygons. c) Once editing for both polygon and line features was completed, attributes required by the Federal Standards were added, both by automated attribution methods (with ArcHydro tools) and by manually entering them in the attribute tables (using the NHD and DRG as visual reference). d) NAIP imagery was used in the areas specified in the "Line source" field of the line feature's attribute table to improve accuracy of both pour points and the delineated boundaries in accordance with this more recent photography. e) All 1:24,000-scale linework and attribution was reviewed internally and corrections were made accordingly. f) 100% of the 1:24,000-scale linework was then reviewed internally by WyGISC, then again by Lorri Peltz-Lewis, Regional Geospatial Database Administrator U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, California, and Donna Knifong, GIS Specialist U.S. Geological Survey, California Water Science Center. A final external review was conducted by Kimberly Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey, Utah Water Science Center. All comments for revision were collectively considered and corrections were then incorporated into the final California Watershed Boundary Dataset.</stepDesc></prcStep><prcStep xmlns=""><stepDesc>Metadata was created and imported into the final statewide California Watershed Boundary Dataset.</stepDesc></prcStep><prcStep xmlns=""><stepDesc>Seven coordination meetings were conducted across the state of California with Federal, State, and Local agencies to provide consensus building on the delineation effort. This effort also included OR, NV, and AZ participation. Wherever available, pre-existing local level watershed and hydrologic data were collected and wherever utilized, enhanced to meet both map accuracy and WBD standards. These data predominately included US Forest Service and San Francisco Bay Lands. Note* Exceptions to the normal delineation methods of hydrologic boundaries exist in some areas where local data was fully incorporated into the final dataset. Two such exceptions the delineation methods are described as follows: 1) In areas where USFS data was incorporated the pour point delineation method was also included as an exception to the normal method of pour point delineation. These instances occur where single line streams connect with larger double line rivers and the pour point is located at the center of the river rather than directly across the stream along the river bank. 2) In the San Francisco Bay area the local experts ageed to and requested specifically the use and integration of the San Francisco Estuary Institute (SEFI) marsh and baylands dataset to define open water and estuary areas.

The NAIP images are to be considered the most current and up-to-date reference data available at the time of delineation; because of this, watershed/subwatershed boundaries may not coincide with other source data - such as DRGs - when such data is used as a backdrop layer.</srcDesc><srcCitatn><resTitle>National Agriculture Imagery Program</resTitle><resAltTitle>NAIP</resAltTitle></srcCitatn><srcExt><exDesc>2006</exDesc></srcExt></dataSource><dataSource xmlns="" type=""><srcDesc>The National Elevation Dataset is a raster representation of elevation at 30-meter resolution.
