# Team Meeting - September 5th, 2018
Attending: Sarah, Rob, Alyssa, Nick, Ryan

Ruling out family and genus level clustering - metrics won't apply across all of them, species level
clustering breaks out (maybe) a bit better than taxa level clustering, and metrics and recommendations
start to be useful across the grouped taxa.

## Central Valley
Like 8 groups at species level aggregation, but want group 1 merged into group 7 and group 3 into group 5

## Dissimilarity
Do one single dissimilarity plot with the four regions, collapsing all species in the region and comparing which species
are located only in one region vs crossing regions. [[Nick or Alyssa]]

## Great Basin
Maybe try two groups [[Nick]] because with 4 taxa, 3 groups might be too many and we start getting artifacts

## North Coast
Remove the stuff out of state and run clusters again [[Nick]]

Output better tables per group
Common names in the output tables

## South Coast
3 groups makes most sense
[[Nick or Alyssa]] investigate why species groups can be the same, look into how the statistical method
does the clustering. Why are we getting distinct groups with the same species? Play with the seed values
for one of the grouping levels and see if we get really different values.
