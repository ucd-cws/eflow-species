# Broader eflows meeting group @TNC

Functional flow metrics - started with "leave one out cross validation"
in order to get good measures of variable importance

generating many forests and taking the median of the medians to get a more stable, narrower prediction interval

Mostly even representation of error spatially, but higher flow snowmelt systems appear more accurate - flashy system have broader error
