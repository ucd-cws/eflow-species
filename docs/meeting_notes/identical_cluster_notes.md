So, maybe we display the data where we show a count of the HUCs that each species is in within a cluster (or percent)
Could also use it as a ranking.


Click on HUC
-- Cluster Assemblage:
        Central Valley fall run Chinook (Cluster HUC count: 31/303 (~10%)) (Range HUC count 31/126 (~20%))
        ... ordered by cluster HUC count (desc)
        ... still not including translocations anywhere
        
-- HUC Assemblage
        doesn't actually include all cluster taxa
        Hardhead
        
-- Region
-- Cluster boundary



Overlay is region boundary and cluster coloration

Export tables of all cluster assemblage (and percent info) for each region so that people don't need to be clicking
back and forth between two clusters. (Might need to do it partially by hand for expediency)

Maybe
