Summary of changes:
* Changes to species taxonomy
* Aggregation of data to species level
* Exclusion of empty and out of state areas
* Exploration of true random seeds
* Clustering without manual region breaks
* Verification of Flow Sensitive Species Lists
* Refinements to regions

## Changes to species taxonomy
PISCES data was updated to reflect recent changes in species taxonomy, which can have an affect
on the clusters created. No changes were made to actual presence records between phase 1 and now
but the taxonomic classification information for the roach species and subspecies was verified
and corrected. Additionally, Tidewater Goby was split into northern and southern species (not
subspecies) based on Swift et al, 2016. The records remain the same, but were distributed between
two taxa, which can (and appears to) change the resulting clusters.

## Verification of Flow Sensitive Taxa Lists
Rob Lusardi looked over the list of taxa we consider to be "flow sensitive", which is based
on prior research completed and published with Ted Grantham. At this time, no changes have been
made to the list of taxa we consider to be flow sensitive. 

## Aggregation of data to species level
We recognized that species with many ESUs/DPSs/subspecies can end up having an outsize impact on
the clustering since they overlap heavily, but are considered different taxa in the clustering 
algorithm. We tested aggregating presence up to species, genus, and family levels prior to clustering
and ultimately decided that using species-level clustering was superior to subspecies, genus, or
family clustering because it produces fewer artifacts and less chaotic clusters. Subjectively
the clusters appear to be more meaningful from a management standpoint.

## Exclusion of empty and out of state areas
Through examination of clusters, we determined that formation of regions was often heavily influenced
by large, out of state areas, for which PISCES lacks range data, We excluded all HUCs that don't
contain any non-translocated native fish from clustering to mitigate this. It removed some areas
in-state that may have translocations, or which may be empty as well. Clustering improved as a result.

## Exploration of true random seeds
We returned to our original methods briefly to examine how a traditional Kmeans algorithm that
doesn't force contiguous regions performs now that we are aggregating to species-level before
clustering. In limited testing (7 runs for one region, and viewing 6 of 27 runs for statewide
clustering), we observed instability in clustering with different random seeds using the
standard kmeans algorithm. The statewide clustering exhibited much more stability, but we
believed it was less useful from a management standpoint than contiguous clusters since distant
HUCs can end up in the same cluster.

## Clustering without manual region breaks
We also tried clustering statewide, without our subregions prior to clustering, but still
requiring contiguous regions. This performed decently well, with a few unusual regions (including
one that crossed from western Sacramento Valley hills into the Klamath). We largely felt that
the clusters produced here validated our region splits because most clusters were contained to the
watershed boundaries we used for region splitting. We decided to continue splitting regions
because it allows us to better target a manageable and useful set of clusters that balances
across the state.

## Refinements to regions
We originally removed the Delta after deciding it was driving too much of the central valley's
clustering with too narrow of an area. We felt it would best be managed on its own.
Clustering improved after this changed, but we noticed significant artifacting in HUCs flowing
into the San Francisco Bay or Suisun Marsh, primarily in the HUCs located in the North Coast
region. To mitigate this, HUCs that flow into Suisun Bay (HUC_10 1805000101) were moved from the
North Coast region to the Central Valley region where they have more in common with their neighbors.
We also removed HUCs draining immediately into the San Francisco Bay and the Bay itself, using
the 3 HUC 10s that make up the Bay proper and surrounding marshlands (but not hillsides that drain
into the bay). We did this for the same reasons we removed the Delta - these areas will have unique
managment considerations separate from the clusters and were driving clustering to an unhelpful
degree.

## Some clusters have the same species list
This is a problem Nick is still investigating, where within a region, some clusters will have the
same list of present species.
